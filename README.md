# Babel

In the world of database management systems, relational databases are dominate. This isn't too surprising since a relational database can be used to solve many problems. However, using a relational database as a solution is not always the most efficient answer.

Babel seeks to alleviate the problem of a company being locked-in to using a RDBMS. A company isn't going to throw away their data stored in a RDBMS to restart with a graph database even if it might speed up their query times. However, if given a tool that was to fully export their data to a Neo4j system, they might. 

Babel is the tool for transforming a Microsoft SQL Server database into a Neo4j database.

## Usage

To use Babel, compile and run the code after configuring the two database connection strings correctly. Babel will handle the rest!
